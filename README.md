User-contributed microtext posting service which allows users to upload short pieces of text

# Description

Kizbu is a text-only system as it consists mainly of text characters instead of bitmapped or vector graphics.All of the application main content uses justified alignment in order to include the maximum number of text-based information.
The software provides the possibility of uploading limited characters of text (up to 180).

Everytime you upload text,random font families and sizes are used for each post on the main page and other subpages.Also,once you upload your post, a random kind of color will be defined for each one.
